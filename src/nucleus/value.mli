(** The values are "finished" or "computed" results. They are inert pieces
    of data.

    At the moment the only kind of value is a pair [(e,t)] where [e] is a
    term and [t] is a type. Such a value (in a given context [ctx]) indicates
    that the judgemnet [ctx |- e : t] is derivable. *)
type value = Tt.term * Tt.ty

(** A result of computation at the moment is necessarily just a pure value
    because we do not have any operations in the language. But when we do,
    they will be results as well (and then handlers will handle them). *)
